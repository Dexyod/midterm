Order Pick-up App
==================
The main goal of this project was to demonstrate an app that can be quickly utilized to setup
ordering and pickup of merchandise. Merchants can reach their customers without the need for a brick and morter store front that are now mostly shuttered due to COVID-19. This is demonstrated with our 'Kevin Bacout' app, a ficticious bacon restaurant. The app displays a vibrant but simple interface that will be simple for merchant to setup and for eager customers to use to place orders. The app will seamlessly communicate via text messages between merchants and their customers whenever an order is placed the site. The cost of setup is very minimal in terms of time and expertise needed from the merchant. We have taken care of all the complexities order place ment and communication through to the end of the transaction. Give a us a few minutes of your time and we will demonstrate how this app can open many opertunities a merchant to reach their customers more effectively.
